## Pleasure
- A desirable affective state
  - Often arises from satisfaction, mastery, or stimulation

## Fun
A subset of pleasurable experiences, typically associated with:
- Playfulness (non-serious engagement, exploratory or competitive)
- Challenge and mastery (doing, achieving, testing limits)
- Surprise and variation (novelty, unpredictability)

Fun is more about dynamic engagement than mere consumption of pleasure.


## Game
### Necessary
- Emotional value: A game affords the potential to evoke pleasure during the experience
  - This need not necessarily be "fun"
  - This does not imply the overall emotional value has to be desirable
- Autonomy: The player can make decisions and act on them
- Interactivity: The game system changes in response to the player's actions

### Sufficient
- ?

## Toy
- A system with autonomy and interactivity, but without explicit goals
- Toys can still be fun, but they do not impose objectives on the player
