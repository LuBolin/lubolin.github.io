# Discussion
The thought arose when sitting in Game Design class.
Is Minecraft creative mode a game?
It had no goal, it has no risk, it had no opposition.
Any goal in it are arbitrary and artificial.
*Games are human designed, and so in this case artificial refers to being produced by an entity beyond the designer.*
If anything, it is closer to Lego than it is to Minecraft survival mode.

Without introducing unnecessary bloat, a simple definition can be
  An activity is a game *iff* it has a non-artificial goal.

But seldom, if ever, do we hear anyone calling Rubik's Cube a game.
Why is that.

Idk.
