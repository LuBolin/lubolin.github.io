## Discussion

In class we talked about whether players are actually open to innovation.
And I think the answer is yes, but it depends on *how* you approach it.

There's 2 "formulaic" basically two ways to innovate:
1. Start with a cool new mechanic, build a game around it
2. Start with a feeling you want to create, then invent mechanics to produce that feeling

I think the second one works way better.

## Quick MDA Recap

The MDA framework says games have three layers:
- **Mechanics**: the rules
- **Dynamics**: what happens when you play
- **Aesthetics**: how it makes you feel

Designers think Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics.
Players experience it backwards: Aesthetics → Dynamics → Mechanics.

## The Problem with "Cool Mechanic First"

When you start with "here's a novel mechanic," you run into issues.

The mechanic might be brilliant, but players don't see mechanics first. They see the experience.
And if they can't immediately tell *why* this weird new thing exists, it just feels arbitrary.
Like "okay but why am I doing this?"

Also there's a learning cost. Players have to learn your new system before they can enjoy it.
That's a big ask if they don't know what they're getting.

Finally, to start with a cool mechanic, you have to come up with the cool mechanic first.
That's hard! Innovation is hard. You might end up with something that feels forced or gimmicky.

## Starting with the Feeling
But starting with aesthetics allows easy innovation through recombination.

Taking an aesthetic goal, even sampling from an existing game (like "I want that farming experience from Stardew Valley") gives you a clear target.

Then, we can try to achieve said aesthetic with a unique mechanic / medium, like "what if I used RTS mechanics to create that farming experience?"

With aesthetics driven innovation, you can mix and match existing mechanics in new ways to achieve the desired feeling.
This lowers the bar for innovation, since you're not inventing something from scratch.
Plus, players can immediately understand the goal: "Oh, this game is trying to make me feel X."

## Conclusion
Idk, this is one approach. A little hacky, but it might help get past the innovation barrier.
